# This data is a mess. Where is the code book? Is this real NES data or some bs
# made up sample? This is a really good place to write down some thoughts on
# this data and where it comes from. Take a look at ROAS, pages 141 -- 142.

# We are trying to explain partyid7, which is the party identification of each
# respondent. Can we treat this as continuous? I think that lower numbers mean
# more Democratic.

# real_ideo is missing a lot. Should we just get rid of those rows? Depends on
# the time period we care about . . .

x <- nes %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  select(year, partyid7, real_ideo, race_adj, 
         age_discrete, educ1, female, income) %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(gender = as.factor(ifelse(female == 1, "female", "non-female"))) %>% 
  mutate(race = as.factor(case_when(race_adj == 1 ~ "White",
                                    race_adj == 2 ~ "Black",
                                    TRUE ~ "Other")))
  
```

```{r model_1, cache=TRUE}
# What is the relationship, if any, between partyid7 and female? We will treat
# partyid7 as a continuous variable for this exercise, even though it is a
# categorical variable with 7 levels. Recall that 1 means Strong Democrat, 2
# means Democrat and so on, finishing with 7 for Strong Republican.

fit_1 <- stan_glm(data = x, partyid7 ~ gender, refresh = 0)
```

```{r model_2, cache=TRUE}
# What about the relationship between race and party ID? Need to have created a
# factor variable, or at least a character variable.

fit_2 <- stan_glm(data = x, partyid7 ~ race, refresh = 0)

## Model Results

Here is a nicely printed summary of my model results, showing the relationship between party ID, on a 1 through 7 scale, and ideology, also on a 1 through 7 scale. Although these are ordered categories, I treat both variables as continuous.

```{r show_the_model, comment=NA}
print(fit_3, detail = FALSE, digits = 2)
```

It isn't the best thing I could imagine. I really want to figure out a way to add a caption. But it will do for now. 

Instead of just printing the simple object, we could print its summary.


```{r show_the_model_summary, comment=NA}
print(summary(fit_3), detail = FALSE, digits = 2)
```

But that adds a bunch of junk, including run-off-the-page text. Maybe there are options in something like `print.stanmvreg()` which might be helpful. Has no one bothered to ask on RStudio Community?

```{r left_over, include=FALSE}
predictions <- x %>%

  mutate(pred_gender = predict(fit_1, x)) %>% 
  mutate(pred_race = predict(fit_2, x)) %>% 
  mutate(pred_idea = predict(fit_3, x))# Interesting rows.

# How similar/different are these predictions?



# Make a graphic showing relationship between party_id and gender prediction

print(summary(predictions))

predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pred_gender, y = partyid7)) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = gender), width = .03, height = .3, alpha = .08) +

  ggtitle("Party ID v. Gender-Predicted Party Id")

# We are trying to understand the party_id7. 

# How do we know if a prediction is good?

# How much do bad predictions differ?

# Think about penalty functions and decision-making.

# details of the model. And, yes, you will be seeing questions similar to this
# on the exam!

new_ideo <- x %>%
  mutate(real_ideo_new = real_ideo -1)

model_fit_2

# Now fit the model for a single year. The coefficient values are different!
# Which ones are true?

# Let's do as ROAS does and fit the model for each year. Recall all your
# list-column tricks from Gov 1005.

# Once we have that collection of models. Can we make a plot which looks like at
# least one of the panes from page 142?

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(x = partyid7, y = real_ideo)) +
